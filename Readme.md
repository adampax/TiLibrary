### Adding a Module

  - Create a folder with your module's name
  - Place all required dependencies in the folder along with the module
  - Add a Readme.md file with any notes and changes that have been made
  - Add the module to the root Readme.md file with the status of the port and a link to the original source if applicable.

### Why did we do this?

We are continually porting scripts to Titanium and coping them from old projects to new project. So this is our way of making life easier.

### Whats next?

We have many other modules we will be adding very soon and eventually we will also release our package manager we use internally.
